"""
Sample-specific script for sample2 — tests that wildcard expansion in script
paths selects the correct per-sample script.

This is intentionally a separate file (not a symlink) to prove that the
executor expands {wildcards.sample} in the script path BEFORE adding it to
transfer_input_files.  If expansion failed, the EP would receive the wrong
script (or none at all).

This script imports from stats_helpers.py to test the htcondor_transfer_input_files feature.
